# Deep Learning Hello World Project

Libraby:
* Keras
* Tensorflow backend

Dense class:
* Fully-connected network structure with three layers
* Modify optimizer - sgd

Network structure:
* Visible layer - 784 inputs
* Hidden layer - 120 neurons
* Hidden layer - 30 neurons
* Output layer - 10 outputs

Activation function:
* Relu
* Softmax

Data:
[Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data)

* Deep leanring is an advanced field. 
* It took me a while to finally start to understand what is it about.  
* I chose Keras for its simplicity. Easier to understand compared with Tensorflow and Theano.
