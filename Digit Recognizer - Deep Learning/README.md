* Hidden layer - 120 neurons
* Hidden layer - 30 neurons
* Output layer - 10 outputs

Activation function:
* Relu
* Softmax

Data:
[Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data)

* Deep leanring is a very advanced field. It took me a while to finally start to understand what is it about.  
* In this project, I used the Keras library. Keras is simple and easier to understand. It's simpler to me compared with Tensorflow or Theano - the backend.
