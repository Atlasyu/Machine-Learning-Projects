# Deep Learning Hello World Project

Libraby:
* Keras
* Tensorflow backend

Dense class:
* Fully-connected network structure with three layers
* Modify optimizer - sgd

Data:
[Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data)

* Deep leanring is a very advanced field. It took me a while to finally start to understand what is it about.  
* In this project, I used the Keras library. Keras is simple and easier to understand. It's simpler to me compared with Tensorflow or Theano - the backend.
